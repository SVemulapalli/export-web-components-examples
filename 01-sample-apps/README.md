# sample-apps

Each framework has implemented the same application in this folder. The application is a very basic grocery list that allows you to add a grocery item and then check/uncheck it.

## Components

Each framework is made up of the following components:

1. App / main container
1. Title
1. Add grocery
1. List groceries

## Coloring

Each framework applies a color tint to each component based on the framework they are from. This is helpful later when we mix the components in a single app.

- Angular = red
- React = blue
- Vue = green
